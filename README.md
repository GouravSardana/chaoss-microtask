# chaoss-microtask
The repository contains solutions for micro tasks  given by CHAOSS project
# Microtask3 - Produce a listing of repositories, as a table and as CSV file, with the number of commits authored, issues opened, and pull requests opened, during the last three months, ordered by the total number (commits plus issues plus pull requests).


# Microtask 5: Produce a pull request for GHData and try to follow instructions until it gets accepted. Try do do something simple that you consider useful, not necessarily fix to the code: improvement of comments, documentation or testing will usually be easier to get accepted, and very useful for the project. Please, avoid just producing a random pull request just to have another microtask: the objective is not that you get one more microtask done, but that you understand how to interact with developers in the project contributing with something that could be useful.
